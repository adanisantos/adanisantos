My first steps in technology area was by the Computer Science class when I was a child.
This class I learn about Excel, Create and write document on Word and then thought me parts of computer like Keyboard, Mouse, MotherBoard.
I complete my degree. I graduated at Civil Engeenering. Some subjects were about computing soo I had to learn programming logic level 1, 2 and 3.
Adverse circumstances forced me to change my path. 2019 was my first attempt at technology. In 2024, I dedicated myself fully to this field.
